# zshrc

My config of zshrc. Easy to install and easy to maintain. For power user, you can just write your own zshrc and use this as a template.

## Alias Support

You can add some alias to 'alias.local', such as

```bash
alias isabelle="/home/tecty/.bin/Isabelle2019/Isabelle2019 &"
alias rm="trash"
alias cse="ssh cse"
```

which [trash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/trash-cli) will safely move things to trash in different system. And it can safe you from removing your assignment accidentaly.
